# rock-paper-scissors
My first original iOS app: Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

This project represents my learning process with SwiftUI.
You'll find earlier commits with messy code, and later refactors as I learn better practices.


## ðŸ”ˆ Sound Effects
This app uses external sound effects (correct.mp3, wrong.mp3),  
which are **not included in this repository** due to licensing restrictions.  
Please add your own or modify the `playSound(named:)` function accordingly.

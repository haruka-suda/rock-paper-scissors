# rock-paper-scissors
My first original iOS app: Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

This project represents my learning process with SwiftUI.
You'll find earlier commits with messy code, and later refactors as I learn better practices.

## About this project

This app was developed as a part of my learning process in iOS development with Swift.  
All development is committed from the very beginning, including refactoring and trial-and-error stages,  
to show my learning and decision-making process transparently.

Feel free to explore the commit history to see how the project evolved!

## ðŸ”ˆ Sound Effects
This app uses external sound effects (correct.mp3, wrong.mp3),  
which are **not included in this repository** due to licensing restrictions.  
Please add your own or modify the `playSound(named:)` function accordingly.
